		NB: Ideally, everything js should be put here into one file (per page if
				reasonable).
				This index.js file should log "yay." for testing purposes.

				Heads up!
				As i am using codekit (https://incident57.com/codekit/) for combining
				js files, you either have to use it too or setup your own task flow.
				Codekit is paid software, so, if you do not want to pay, you could use
				grunt (http://gruntjs.com/) or gulp (http://gulpjs.com/). There is even
				a java tool that handles that kind of stuff (i guess), called
				dandelion (http://dandelion.github.io/). Please talk to me, if the latter
				seems to be the best option for you.
